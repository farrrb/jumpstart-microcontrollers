... to my first attempt to write a book "Jump Start Microcontrollers". Inspired by
the process of jump starting a car with dead batteries. I'll try to show you how to
"jump start" a microcontroller.

We will begin with zero and I'll show you how to get and use the information to awake
Frankenstein's Monster (our target board, the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/)). My current plan is to do everything in plain old [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) with no assembly needed at all. I sure hope this plan will work out (no promises).

Also I'll try to use only [FOSS](https://en.unesco.org/foss) products and as little of the (proprietary) vendor libraries as possible.

# Is this book right for me?
If you can answer any of that question with a **"yes"**, a **"definitely"** or a **"omg I always wanted to know something about that"**, this book should be the right choice for you.
- Do you want to learn to set up microcontroller projects from the bottom up?
- Do you want to learn how to get up a running C/C++ environment on your own?
- Do you want to learn something more of the Cortex-M0?
- Do you want to know how to read the microcontroller manuals to get the information you'll need?

# Resources
The [Resource](resources.md) page will be updated continuously, so that you'll find every PDF, every website and
every book I'll reference throughout this book there.

# About Me
The good old "Who am I?"" and "What have I accomplished so far?"

Hey, I am Fabian Zahn and I am an Embedded Software Engineer working for [Jungheinrich](https://www.jungheinrich.com/) (forklift trucks and interlogistics) for the last five years.

I really like my job and all about embedded software (who doesn't?). I studied electrical engineering years ago just to find out how computers *really* work. Initially I wanted to study informatics but I always wondered how everything fits together from the highest level language to the tiniest transistor. So electrical engineering was the obvious (and right) choice for me.

As a last remark I would like to point out that I am not a native speaker (I am actually from Germany, the country with the velvety soft language). So please feel free to question and or correct my English at any time.

# Contributing

# License
My role model in terms of writing books, [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob), did come up with a very smart approach which I adapted: A [dual license](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/LICENSE).
It is worth reading his reasoning behind is license approach, so feel free to do so.
